Credit Card Fraud Detection System

Overview

This project implements a Credit Card Fraud Detection System using machine learning techniques. The dataset used contains transaction details and labels indicating whether a transaction is fraudulent or not.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project is creditcard.csv, which includes transaction details such as:

Time

Various anonymized numerical features (V1, V2, ..., V28)

Amount

Class (0: Non-Fraud, 1: Fraud)

Features

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, scaling numerical features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Checking class distribution, visualizing data.

Model Training: Logistic Regression for fraud classification.

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report.

Installation & Usage

Upload the dataset (creditcard.csv) to Google Colab.

Run the provided Python script.

View model performance metrics.
Results

The model achieves high accuracy in detecting fraudulent transactions.

Further improvements can be made using advanced ML algorithms like Random Forest or Neural Networks.

Contributions

Feel free to contribute by optimizing the model, improving feature selection, or integrating deep learning techniques.
